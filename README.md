# CloudFormation Drift Detector

Perform regular drift detection on every stacks and report drifts by email automatically.

‚ùó Drift detection triggers way to many false positive for now, this project might spam you with emails where you can't do anything. There are many bug issues open, see https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-coverage-roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+drift+detection+label%3Abug

## How does it work ?

- Detection
    1. The `DetectionSchedule` scheduler triggers the `DetectStackDrifts` lambda. By default, it runs every 15 minutes between 6 AM and 7 AM everyday. (It allows retries in case of Throttling by CloudFormation).
    2. For each selected `Regions` the lambda lists all the stacks and filters the ones matching `IgnoreStackIdRegex` and the ones that have already have a drift detection with a age smaller than `DriftAgeCheckHours` (23 hours by default).
    3. Loop over all the stacks and call the `DetectStackDrift` API.

- Notification
    1. The `NotificationSchedule` scheduler triggers the `NotifyStackDrifts` lambda. By default, it runs at 7:45 AM everyday, this should leave enough time for the drift detection and potential retries to finish.
    2. For each selected `Regions` the lambda lists all the stacks and filters the ones matching `IgnoreStackIdRegex` or the ones that are not drifted.
    3. Depending on `NotifierService`, the lambda will send an HTML or text report to the `Destination` email.

## Development

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace with your desired configuration.
Then run `npm i && npm run build && ./deploy.sh`

## Testing

Run `test/deploy.sh` for a stack with drifts or `test/deploy_many.sh` for 1000 stacks to test with CloudFormation throttling.
